Phoenix 2001 Recallit v2.00 Source Code Release from the O.P.A. 1991 Archive

Here is another great TMS9900 assembly code release from our archives, this program was one of the first to use RAMBO memory to store a name/address database allowing for very fast sorting, searching, etc.

Sadly, over the years I have lost the original manual for it that was included when TI99'ers bought the program from O.P.A. back during the '90s, if anyone has a printed copy they could scan in that would be great!

Enjoy! ðŸ¥³

RECALLIT 2001, was originally a simple Name and Address Lister, but is fast becoming a powerful database.

Using the RAMBO PROGRAM SPACE from 8K to 512K it can store up to 4000 records, each with 10 defined fields. Searching for strings can be done in any field combination. A variety of printouts from labels to two- columns are supported. Re-indexing by any field is possible.

Like other Phoenix 2001 software it has easy-to-learn menus, all contained in a 100% Assembly program. An amazing thing about RECALLIT 2001 combined with RAMBO is the ZERO-TIME sorter, you will never have to wait.
